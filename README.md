This is a collection of useful mini projects to learn python. Categorized by topics in python

## 1. Python Basics
#### Control Flow
1. [Magic 8 Ball](python_basics/magic8ball.py)
* The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.
* Write a magic8ball.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

#### Lists
1. [Pizza List](python_basics/pizza_list.py)
* this script helps practice the basic list manipulations
* the scenario is a pizza place trying to origanize their list of pizzas

#### Loops
1. [Haircut Loop](python_basics/haircut_loop.py)
* practice basic list and loops
* calculate metrics for a barbershop

#### Functions
1. [Easy Physics Functions](python_basics/physics_functions.py)
* some easy functions that help calculate some fundamental physical properties.

#### Strings
1. [Coded Correspondence](python_basics/coded_correspondence/coded_correspondence.ipynb)
* a codecademy practice project
* encoding and decoding messages in string manipulations

#### Dictionaries
1. [Scrabble](python_basics/scrabble_dict.py)
* In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble.
* You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.
2. [Abruptly Goblins Planner](python_basics/abruptly_goblins_dict/Abruptly%20Goblins%20Planner.ipynb)
* a codecademy practice project
* plan a game night using dictionaries

#### Classes
1. [Restaurant Class](python_basics/restaurant_class.py)
* class applications in restaurant origanization
* You will create 3 classes and access their methods, and use them to build a new business
